# Problem Statement

## Problem Description

Most students coming to UMass for the first time are thrown into a completely new environment, with no experience with any type of dining plan at all, much less the unlimited one that is given to freshmen. As a result, students often don't know how to responsibly eat and manage their nutrition in their new on-campus lives, and the "Freshman 15" is evidence of such. UMass Dieting Companion will provide the missing link between nutrition and unlimited access to food, giving tailored diet plans to students based on their needs.

## Proposed Solution

Our web application, **UMass Dieting Companion**, aims to provide nutritional protection from irresponsible dining habits for students coming to UMass, both as freshmen and multi-years. UMass Dieting Companion will allow  users to easily input their physical information and dietary intention (bulk/cut/maintain) and automatically calculate diets detailed down to each dish and dining hall, taking into account any dietary restrictions and requests. Users will have access to nutritional information for each dish recommended, and their diet plan will match the recommended calorie intake, carbohydrate consumption, and protein uptake of their given physical stats and desired result.

Key features include:

- **Diet Plan Calculation**: Automatically calculate diet plans that match
    a given height and weight for the optimal nutritional health.
- **Visualized Nutrition**: Present simple and attractive graphs and charts
    that show the nutritional balance of any given dish (protein/carb/fat).
- **Dietary Restriction Consideration**: Filter out dishes and meals that
    contradict given dietary restrictions and work around them to provide
    healthy nutritional plans for students with specific needs.
- **Multi-Device Access**: Accessible on both desktop and mobile devices, 
    allowing users to make dining decisions and choose locations on the go.

By providing a tool that is both easy to use and packed with convenient and advanced features, UMass Dieting Companion aims to ease the nutritional struggle that comes with the #1 college dining in the country.

## Why This Matters

UMass Students are constantly challenged with the problem of dining responsibly, especially when the University automatically gifts students a dining plan with, quite literally, no limits. In combination with the stresses and anxieties provided by exams, homeworks, and extracurriculars all within college life, this unguided access to dining often results in bad eating habits and unhealthy results. Without some sort of guidance in this field, many students fall victim to this unfortunate series of events, and "the freshman 15" is clear-cut evidence of such; first-years are thrown into this environment and nearly all end up gaining around 15 pounds purely through the unlimited access to dining. This application will, God willing, provide a solution to such students and create a form of guidance for them in this unilluminated field. Students can use UMass Dieting Companion to assist them in this struggle of theirs, making it extremely easy to get the instructions they need for the diet they're looking for.

# Target Users

## Primary Audience

The primary users of our web application are UMass Amherst students of all levels (undergraduate and graduate), who are looking to manage their diet and nutrition more efficiently. These students often live on campus or in off campus housing nearby and regularly use the UMass dining halls. They may have specific dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, vegetarian, halal), food allergies, or fitness goals (e.g., high-protein, weight management), and are looking for easy, customizable meal plans that align with their health goals. 
Another key user group includes UMass Amherst student-athletes or fitness enthusiasts who require specific calorie and macronutrient targets to maintain or improve their physical performance. They often need tailored meal plans that provide the necessary nutrients for energy, recovery, and endurance.
Finally, students with dietary restrictions (such as gluten intolerance or lactose intolerance) are another important group. These students require meal plans that avoid certain ingredients while still providing balanced, nutritious options.

## User Needs

UMass Amherst students need a convenient way to generate meal plans based on the daily menu from UMass Dining. These students are typically balancing a busy schedule of classes, clubs, and work, leaving little time for detailed meal planning. They need an app that allows them to quickly input their dietary preferences and receive meal options that meet their nutritional requirements.

Athletes and fitness enthusiasts, on the other hand, need meal plans that match specific macronutrient goals, particularly high-protein meals or meals tailored to muscle gain, fat loss, or maintaining. They need the app to generate accurate calorie counts and suggest foods from UMass Dining that fit their performance-related dietary needs.

Students with dietary restrictions require an app that can filter out unwanted ingredients and ensure that the meals suggested meet their needs without risking allergen exposure. They need clear, reliable options for avoiding specific allergens or foods that don't align with their health concerns. 

## Why These Users Matter

These user groups are critical to the success of the application because they represent a large portion of the UMass Amherst student population who depend on UMass Dining for daily meals. By addressing the dietary needs and preferences of students, the application can improve their overall dining experience, promoting better health, convenience, and satisfaction.

For athletes, personalized meal planning helps them maintain optimal performance and energy levels, ensuring that they meet their physical goals while saving time on nutrition management. Similarly, catering to students with dietary restrictions ensures their health and safety while dining, filling an essential gap in existing campus resources.

By solving these specific problems, the app will provide a valuable service that helps UMass students maintain a healthy lifestyle, save time, and meet their personal dietary needs.

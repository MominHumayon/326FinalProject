# Target Users

## Primary Audience

The primary users of our web application are UMass Amherst students of all levels (undergraduate and graduate), who are looking to manage their diet and nutrition more efficiently. These students often live on campus or in off campus housing nearby and regularly use the UMass dining halls. They may have specific dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, vegetarian, halal), food allergies, or fitness goals (e.g., high-protein, weight management), and are looking for easy, customizable meal plans that align with their health goals. 
Another key user group includes UMass Amherst student-athletes or fitness enthusiasts who require specific calorie and macronutrient targets to maintain or improve their physical performance. They often need tailored meal plans that provide the necessary nutrients for energy, recovery, and endurance.
Finally, students with dietary restrictions (such as gluten intolerance or lactose intolerance) are another important group. These students require meal plans that avoid certain ingredients while still providing balanced, nutritious options.

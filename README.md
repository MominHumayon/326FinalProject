Running the Application
To run the application, ensure you have Node.js (LTS version recommended) and npm installed on your system. SQLite is required for database setup.

For the backend, navigate to the backend directory using the terminal and run npm install to install the necessary dependencies. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the server by running node server.js. The backend server will typically run on http://localhost:3001.

For the frontend, locate the navBar.html file in the frontend folder. Right-click on the file and select the "Live Server" option. This will open the frontend in your default web browser and make it accessible online.

To access the application, ensure both the frontend and backend are running simultaneously. The frontend can be accessed through the browser, and the backend API will be available at http://localhost:3001

# UMass Dieting Companion - Problem Statement

## Problem Description

At the University of Massachusetts Amherst, first-year students face a significant dietary challenge: transitioning from structured home meals to an unlimited dining plan system. This transition, combined with academic stress and newfound independence, often leads to poor nutritional choices. Studies show that 60-70% of college freshmen gain weight, with the average gain being 7.5 pounds (significantly contributing to the "Freshman 15" phenomenon).

Specific challenges include:
- Lack of portion control guidance in an unlimited dining environment
- Limited understanding of nutritional balance
- Difficulty in maintaining dietary goals (athletic, health, or personal)
- No centralized system for tracking dining hall nutrition

## Target Users

Primary users:
- First-year UMass students adjusting to campus dining
- Student athletes managing specific nutritional needs
- Students with dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.)
- Health-conscious students looking to maintain specific diets

## Current Alternatives

Existing solutions fall short:
1. Generic calorie tracking apps: Don't integrate with UMass dining hall menus
2. UMass Dining website: Provides basic nutritional information but no personalized guidance
3. General nutrition websites: Not tailored to college dining environments

## Proposed Solution

UMass Dieting Companion will be a web-based platform that bridges the gap between unlimited dining access and responsible nutrition management.

### Core Features

1. **Personalized Diet Planning**
   - Input physical stats and goals
   - Automatic calculation of optimal macro/micronutrient needs
   - Daily meal suggestions based on current dining hall menus
   - Customizable meal plans for different dietary preferences

2. **Smart Nutrition Visualization**
   - Interactive charts showing nutritional breakdown
   - Progress tracking over time
   - Visual portion size guidance
   - Weekly and monthly nutrition trends

3. **Dining Hall Integration**
   - Real-time menu updates from all UMass dining locations
   - Nutritional information for every dish
   - Dietary restriction filtering
   - Location-based recommendations

4. **Student Debit Tracking**
   - Tracks and displays the remaining meal swipes and UCard balance for students.
   - Provides real-time updates when swipes or UCard balance is incremented or decremented.
   - Stores the swipe and UCard usage history for the past two weeks.
   - Allows users to view detailed usage trends through a history chart for better financial planning.

## Technical Implementation

The application will:
- Source data directly from UMass Dining App
- Implement secure user authentication
- Store user preferences and dietary information
- Comply with FERPA and data privacy requirements

## Success Metrics

We will measure success through:
1. User adoption rate among first-year students
2. Reduction in reported weight gain among users
3. User satisfaction surveys
4. Engagement metrics (daily active users, feature usage)
5. Dietary goal achievement rates

## Why This Matters

The impact of poor nutritional habits extends beyond freshman year, affecting:
- Academic performance
- Mental health and stress levels
- Physical health and fitness
- Long-term dietary habits

By providing structured guidance during this crucial transition period, UMass Dieting Companion will:
- Promote healthier eating habits
- Support student wellness initiatives
- Enhance the UMass dining experience
- Provide valuable data for improving campus dining services

## Next Steps

1. Conduct user research with current students
2. Partner with UMass Dining for data access
3. Develop prototype for user testing
4. Collaborate with nutrition department for expert input
5. Plan pilot program for Fall 2024 semester
